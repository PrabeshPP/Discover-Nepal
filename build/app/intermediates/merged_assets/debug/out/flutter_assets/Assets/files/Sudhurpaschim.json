It lies in the extreme south-western section of Nepal's Terai in Kanchanpur District. The National Park shares a common boundary with the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in the south and west which is formed by the Mahakali (Sarda)river, a major tributary of the Ganges. It is bordered on the eastern side by the Chaudhar River and to the north by a forest belt and cultivations. A total of 24 mammal species are recorded by Schaff (1978b), a total of 350 species of birds of which 180 are breeding species (Inskipp, 1989), Bhatt and Shrestha (1977) provide an annotated list of 14 species of fish, Schaaf (1978b) recorded 10 species of ectoparasites and biting flies.

            "desc":"The Dodhara Chandani Bridge , commonly known as Mahakali Bridge is a suspension bridge  for pedestrians and at this point only about 1496.5 m long over Mahakali River in the far west of Nepal.\nThe Dodhara Chandani Bridge is a sequence of four suspension bridges with eight pylons, which are anchored to large anchor blocks on both banks as well as three common anchor blocks in the river bed. The lands between the 32.72-metre-high (107.3 ft) pylons have a wingspan of 225.40 m, the webs between the anchors and the pylons have a wingspan of almost 70 meters. The bridge segments are curved slightly upwards. The result is a series of arches of spans of 70 + 225.40 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 225.40 + 225.40 + 70 + 70 + 70 + 225.40 with a total length of 1452.96 m plus of approximately 20 m long anchor blocks on the banks.\nThe bridge consists of the steel pylons and essentially of wire ropes. The hangers are thin metal rods, which are connected to each other with eyes. The 1.60-metre-wide (5.2 ft) bridge deck is a sturdy metal grille. On both sides serve ropes as handrails, which are connected by wire mesh with the bridge deck. Diagonal cables between the railings and the underlying longitudinal cables are used for stiffening, as well as some stay cables of the pylons for the bridge deck. Side, anchored in the riverbed ropes dampen fluctuations.\nThe bridge is designed as a pedestrian bridge, but bicycles and motorcycles can use the bridge as well. There is enough room so that motorcycles can pass even if they are fully loaded. All traffic travels on the left-hand side, as everywhere else in Nepal."
