The Lumbini inscription is generally categorized among the Minor Pillar Edicts of Ashoka, although it is in the past tense and in the ordinary third person (not the royal third person), suggesting that it is not a pronouncement of Ashoka himself, but a rather later commemoration of his visit in the area."

As the world’s only contemporary museum of the Buddha and his Birthplace, the Museum will be the anchor that sets the stage and enhances a visitor’s experience of Nepal’s most sacred site. What happened here, some 2,600 years ago, shifted the consciousness of millions, and continues to resound with a universal clarity that impacts people in the most fundamental aspects of their life.\nWhile the broad outlines of Siddhartha’s life are familiar to all Buddhists, there are many forgotten stories about Siddhartha’s youth and his return visits to Kapilavastu in later years, hidden within the various Buddhist traditions. Contemporary scholarship is increasingly coming to recognise how these precious narratives shaped and nourished the faithful lives of Buddhist communities of the past.\nWith your help, the Lumbini Museum will bring to life these sacred stories that provide a glimpse into the wealth and profundity of Buddhist teaching."
